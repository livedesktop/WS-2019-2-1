Kingdoms is about forging alliances, political mind games, city-building and castle sieges with thousands of other players. Cast as a feudal lord or lady, players begin with a single village and keep. They must design and defend their castle before turning their eye to the rest of the country, Europe and the world! Whatever path they choose players will find strength in numbers as they band together, uniting with local Factions and player-led Houses.\r\n\r\nBesiege the castle that’s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction’s war efforts, pillage your neighbor’s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all! Factions, elections, liege lords and their vassals come together to form a feudal community of real players with whom to discuss strategies and build allegiances.\r\n \r\nWhile an impregnable castle should be at the heart of any kingdom, you can also specialize with a vast research tree. Starting as a humble peasant each promotion provides valuable research points to spend on trading, diplomacy, warfare, farming or religion. Beware as your power grows so does your responsibility.

In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace.

Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P9FT3QJN0PK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hearts Free !","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57209.14143981274591232.de1598a9-9189-4d06-982c-fc78abf82536.c0968af1-eafc-4282-9324-e5ce1510dd87","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28767.14143981274591232.bd4c90dd-8b28-406d-a558-a5845ada8d25.99ec4dd7-2abf-48af-a480-a8e041dfc860","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.317.14143981274591232.9eddbfa3-322f-4c32-8f2a-b316cc5f3166.f016148c-3194-494c-8236-77f3b73af2e1","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13476.14143981274591232.eaee285c-9949-4919-890e-a614d604f4ee.e2c0fc54-d258-4516-9ab8-5b4b523beb58","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29130.14143981274591232.f07ee5e8-df40-407b-b88a-c2b8623d4680.4db1381a-4c77-42e7-b4b7-485c8dfc388c","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22726.14143981274591232.6c378b8f-c1f0-4c30-bd09-e85c99dafbb1.57575fa8-256a-4718-8105-291173f5e000","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45451.14143981274591232.25922f65-9017-4998-930f-0d8e0cff2b4b.a3eb29a9-1d3f-4b4e-ae9b-9d33e7b54ef9","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17005.14143981274591232.22133da3-02b5-4449-8dd6-44fcde02342d.d4739618-52a6-49a1-acfd-d12403afce44","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44083.14143981274591232.942f09a6-6b9b-4e83-9240-36f3fe7e4582.6047e36a-adbe-4f4b-80d4-253ea858631e","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17323.14143981274591232.942f09a6-6b9b-4e83-9240-36f3fe7e4582.5afdbed0-b135-4dd2-bcc1-a52d6d2cff2a","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["TreeCardGames.HeartsFree_n666hb6ddc5jp"],"ContentIds":["43500890-7699-80e0-7261-c81f77db2642","5bb880bb-2d79-2b55-3ae7-ef6d6a4156d4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Hearts is a beautiful free version of the famous trick-taking card game.

Play #1 hit Bridge Construction !\r\nPut your engineering skills, intuition and smarts to test in this brand new Bridge Construction Simulator puzzle game. You will become a constructor who is required to improvise and – most of all – adapt to the task at hand. Use your resources to construct structures able to hold the weight of a car. Try to become a good builder as fast as you can - things will get hard. You won't be racing against the time, so be a careful and thoughtful constructor. For all lovers constructing games and building games like megapolis or sim city builder game.\r\n\r\nYou will design and construct increasingly elaborate bridges across four varied locations. Each one is a different logic puzzle for a thoughtful builder. Things may seem easy when you start out in a city, but once you move to the canyon, valley and finally mountains it will get hard. The task is never impossible, but the size and resilience of your structures will have to increase substantially if you don't want to be responsible for a car crash. Use your logic and skill to become a master bridge builder and break some records along the way!\r\n\r\nIn addition to the normal mode Bridge Construction Simulator offers an easy (for an increased budget and more flexibility) or hard one (for an ultimate, seemingly impossible puzzle challenge that will be able to break even the best builder). There is something for a constructor of every skill level. If you find yourself in a tight spot, a hint system will help guide you to the solution and help you build your skill as a builder. Use the help provided to construct bridges that will not break.\r\n\r\nThe game is a simulator that makes extensive use of realistic physics. As the car drives through the construction you've built you will see it stretch and bend. That way even if you fail you can see the weak points of your construction and use your logic to improve it. Build with your brain and you will be good.\r\n\r\nRealistic and detailed graphics make every level of Bridge Construction Simulator come to life and even offer a slight consolation when you fail as a constructor. Because when your bridge collapses and the car falls down, you can at least expect a spectacular crash! Just enjoy it and don't let it break you - muster your skill and try again! Nothing is ever impossible for an ambitious constructor. Play and become a legendary bridge builder!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NM77SX0G8MV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Slalom Ski Race 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62733.13693236341644899.9d4a386e-9532-48d7-8d2a-f73aef863cbb.39ff6206-a49f-4a9f-a905-e23e8f06c324","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41802.13693236341644899.9d4a386e-9532-48d7-8d2a-f73aef863cbb.d30e3368-6499-4ad4-b897-067b6c95f234","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62733.13693236341644899.9d4a386e-9532-48d7-8d2a-f73aef863cbb.39ff6206-a49f-4a9f-a905-e23e8f06c324","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["42632InstaRoyalSportGames.SlalomSkiRace3D_8gdk6ypn1p9yp"],"ContentIds":["25e3216a-c0d8-582e-d398-461135e9550f","431781f3-b1a7-4f49-b8a9-6c729e0981a6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Welcome to ski slalom tournament in Slalom Ski Race 3D!

every day.\r\n\r\nThe game includes many puzzles:\r\n\r\n* Free puzzles\r\nThe Starter puzzle pack contains 20 puzzles that can be played in any difficulty mode, using any puzzle shape and as many times as you want.\r\n\r\n* Ad sponsored Puzzle of the Day\r\nEvery day we offer a unique puzzle that can be played after watching a short video ad. By watching the video ad, you gain access the puzzle and you can play it like a regular free puzzle. Remember to finish the game before the end of the day, as Puzzle of the Day changes at midnight. \r\nIf you want to play Puzzle of the Day without having to watch ads you can purchase a 'Remove ads' subscription or a 'Premium' subscription. See 'Subscription rules' below for details.\r\n\r\n* Paid puzzle packs\r\nWe offer more than 45 puzzle packs for sale. The typical puzzle pack contains 25 puzzles. Once you purchase a puzzle pack you can customize the puzzles and you can play them anytime you want.\r\n\r\n* Premium subscription\r\nFor dedicated users we offer premium subscriptions. Users with an active subscription can play any puzzle in our library. We offer two types of subscriptions: a monthly subscription and a yearly subscription.\r\nPurchasing a Premium subscription also removes the video ads.\r\n\r\n* Unlock puzzle pack with crowns\r\nWhen playing Puzzle of the Day you can choose to create an account and participate in our daily contest. Top 3 players that solve the puzzle the fastest receive 1 crown reward each at the end of the day. There are 5 contests every day, one for each difficulty level. The earned crowns can be saved and used to unlock more puzzle packs. \r\n\r\nSubscription rules: \r\n1. A subscription will start and renew automatically, and will be charged to your Microsoft Account. You can manage your subscription in your Microsoft Account settings. \r\n2. If the subscription includes a free trial period, you will not be charged during your free trial period. If you are happy with the game, do nothing. When the free trial concludes, your subscription will start and renew automatically, and will be charged to your Microsoft Account. To avoid that, you must cancel the subscription before it expires. Any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when purchasing a subscription.\r\n\r\nPurchase rules:\r\nAny purchase you perform in the game can be played even if you reinstall the game, or if you change your computer. Just remember to login with the same Microsoft Account that you used for performing the purchases and you will be able to play all the puzzles you paid for.\r\n\r\nOffline play:\r\n1. All free puzzles can be played offline.\r\n2. All purchased puzzles can be played offline for 30 days.
